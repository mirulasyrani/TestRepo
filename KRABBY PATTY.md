KRABBY PATTY

The Krabby Patty, a staple of the Krusty Krab, is famously protected by a secret formula. While the exact ingredients remain a mystery, the general understanding of the Krabby Patty's components comes from various SpongeBob episodes and reveals, including "Pickles". 

General Ingredients and Order:

Buns: A bottom bun and a top bun (often with sesame seeds).
Patty: The primary component, which has no confirmed ingredients, but hints suggest it could be made with flour, barnacle shavings, and turmeric.
Lettuce: A layer of lettuce.
Cheese: A slice of cheese, often placed directly on top of the patty.
Onions: Chopped onions.
Tomatoes: Slices or chopped tomatoes.
Ketchup: A spread of ketchup.
Mustard: A spread of mustard.
Pickles: Pickled cucumbers. 

Hidden Ingredients and Love:

The show also suggests other ingredients like tartar sauce, mayo, sea salt, land salt, and barnacle shavings. 
The concept of "love" being an ingredient has also been explored. 
Some fan theories suggest love is a key ingredient, while others suggest it's merely a marketing tactic by Mr. Krabs.
